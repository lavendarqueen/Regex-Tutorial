# Phyllis-Anns-Regex-Tutorial

## Description

This is a tutorial regarding the use and construction of regular expressions (a series of special characters that define a search pattern.) Such a search is used for validation of user names, email address, and other variables requiring authentication in our web applications.

The Regex Tutorial was a fun and education project. When I first started, I had a very rudimentary understanding on the subject of regular expressions. Creating the tutorial gave me a much firmer understanding of how to construct regex expressions, their components, their use, and thei application.

## Installation

Regex expressions, as addressed in our tutorial, are written into our JavaScript code. (Please note that regex can be used in programming languages other than JavaScript, however the syntax varies from one language to another.)

## Usage

The tutorial uses a regex expression that authenticates an email address to demonstrate how to construct a regex search pattern. Please see the screenshot below, showin the color version of the regex expression.
